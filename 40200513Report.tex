    \section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Motivation}
    The motivation for researching "Distributed Teams Established on Explicit Defined Communication Channels" stems from a number of key considerations and the difficulties of modern work contexts.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Surge in popularity of Distributed Team}: The majority of businesses with growing workforces are shifting to distributed team structure, particularly in light of recent pandemics like COVID-19. This makes it much more important in such an environment to collaborate and communicate effectively.. 
        \item \textbf{Accountability}: Having clear channels of communication within the team facilitates awareness of individual roles and responsibilities.
        \item \textbf{Collaboration}: Distributed teams can share project-related materials and do various other project management tasks with each other when they have clear communication channels. 
        \item \textbf{Embrace, Evolve, Adjust}: One must adjust to the changing environment due to changes in new technology, team and company sizes, and the organization can concentrate more on this by employing clear communication channels.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Problem Statement} Due to the larger team size, the distributed team finds it difficult to communicate in person.Also, there are other problems like interrupting coworkers to find resources can waste time, especially when someone is intensely focused and productive. This makes it necessary to create channels for communication, but there was discussion about whether to use synchronous or asynchronous channelsâ€”each having advantages and being able to be selected based on necessity. Therefore, the key to achieving quick growth and productivity in a dispersed team setting is to establish a written communication culture and select clear communication channels.
