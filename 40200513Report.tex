    \subsection{Motivation}

    The motivation for researching "Distributed Teams Established on Explicit Defined Communication Channels" stems from a number of key considerations and the difficulties of modern work contexts.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Surge in popularity of Distributed Team}: The majority of businesses with growing workforces are shifting to distributed team structure, particularly in light of recent pandemics like COVID-19. This makes it much more important in such an environment to collaborate and communicate effectively.. 
        \item \textbf{Accountability}: Having clear channels of communication within the team facilitates awareness of individual roles and responsibilities.
        \item \textbf{Collaboration}: Distributed teams can share project-related materials and do various other project management tasks with each other when they have clear communication channels. 
        \item \textbf{Embrace, Evolve, Adjust}: One must adjust to the changing environment due to changes in new technology, team and company sizes, and the organization can concentrate more on this by employing clear communication channels.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Problem Statement} In distributed team environment, the challenge of effective in-person communication has emerged due to its larger size. Interruptions for resource retrieval are also causing productivity loss, especially when team members are intently focused. The necessity for well-defined communication channels has evolved, accompanied by disputes over the advantages of synchronous versus asynchronous systems. There is a need to build a culture of written communication and to decisively identify and implement clear and effective communication channels in distributed team environment in order to unlock quick growth and better productivity.

    \subsection{Objectives} In this investigation, the key objective of the analysis is to describe the significance of using clear and explicit communication channels within distant work environments to boost productivity, efficiency, reducing interruptions, fill information gaps while also allowing them to grow faster. The ultimate objective is to elevate team performance to a new level, promote alignment, preparing teams to work remotely and build resilient teams that can adjust to change.This will help to simplify project management, particularly when adding new team members, and will be advantageous to managers, team leaders, and team members alike.
